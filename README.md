# HR Analytics - Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores an HR dataset to analyze employee attrition and identify key factors influencing turnover. The goal is to provide insights that help improve employee retention through data-driven HR strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes employee attributes such as satisfaction level, last evaluation score, number of projects, average monthly hours, tenure at company, workplace accidents, promotions, department, and salary level.

## Key Objectives
- Understand the causes of employee attrition
- Explore relationships between workload, satisfaction, promotion, salary, and turnover
- Analyze attrition rates across different departments
- Provide actionable business insights to support retention efforts

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (Data visualization)

## Business Insights

- High workloads and long hours increase the risk of employees leaving.
- Limited promotions reduce motivation and contribute to attrition.
- Attrition varies by department; targeted retention strategies are recommended.
- Salary structures should better align with employee effort, especially for those working long hours.
